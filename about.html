  <h1 style="font-family:helvetica; color:#4682B4">Who We Are</h1>
    <p> Since our founding in 2015, Coltivare has focused on one simple mission: <i>helping farmers</i> grow smarter and more sustainable crops and livestock. What began as a small team of agronomists and aeronautical engineers from Purdue University researching drone automation and computer vision has grown into a trusted provider of innovative products and services for the agriculture industry.
      <br>
      <br>
      Today, Coltivare continues that mission by delivering cutting-edge precision agriculture tools and services. Leveraging our core competencies in drones and computer vision, we help farmers detect issues early—before they escalate—and minimize waste. Our drones and proprietary software enable farmers to more accurately monitor crops and herds and identify key problems such as: water and heat stress, disease, soil erosion, projected yields, and more. 
      <br>
      <br>
      In our first 10 years of operations Coltivare has already become a trusted partner for thousands of farmers providing them with tools and services that enable them to have data driven insights that empower them to optimize farm operations, reduce waste, and drive improvements in sustainability. As we look towards the next decade of operations for our company we remain committed to helping farmers grow smarter and more sustainable crops and livestock by driving innovation in agriculture. </p>

  <h1 style="font-family:helvetica; color:#4682B4"> Company Values</h1>
    <p>Every member of our team commits to upholding these values, reflecting our dedication to farmers and the communities we operate in.</p>

    <h3>CEO and Founder<br>Jane Perdue</h3>
    <p>Jane has had a lifelong passion for agronomy that began as a child when she would visit her grandfather's farm in Northwest Indiana. She has pursued that passion throughout her life by participating in 4H and working for her grandfather at the family farm each summer from 6th to 12th grade. 
      She then went on to pursue her education at Purdue University where she would eventually become a professor in the <a href = "https://www.admissions.purdue.edu/majors/agriculture/index.php" target = "_blank">Purdue University College of Agriculture</a> where she examined and taught about the intersection of technology and agriculture. 
      Coltivare was born out of this research which she was undertaking with funding from the USDA. While Jane did leave her position at Purdue in 2015 to run the company full time, she is still a frequent guest speaker in classes and events. </p>

    <h3>CTO<br>Daniel Mitchells</h3>
    <p>Daniel Mitchells is an expert in drones and camera equipment who has served as Coltivare's CTO since its founding in 2015. 
    His interest and passion in photography began as a child when his parents gave him a toy camera for his third birthday. As he grew older a new passion
    for aviation and aeronautics emerged the stories his grandfather told him about being a pilot in Korea. The marriage of both of these interests came naturally in modern drones
    which he learned both how to use and how to design while he was an aerospace engineering student at Purdue University. It was at Purdue during his work on his masters degree that he met Jane Perdue
    who brought him into her research on technology and agriculture. This fruitful partnership led to Coltivare as we know it today.</p>

    <h3>CIO<br>Matte Painter</h3>
    <p>Matte Painter is an expert in computer vision technologies who prior to joining Coltivare worked on teams at Google and Meta that researched and developed machine learning and neural network algorithms.
    His interest in the subject of computer vision began while he was a student at Harvard, where after discovering his interest in computer vision he immediately dropped out. He spent several years hopping around various startups before settling in for two
    4 year stints at Google and Meta. Today he brings his relentlessly innovative mind and expertise to help farmers notice problems and opportunities as quickly as possible. Matte joined Coltivare in 2019 and his impact on the organization was immediately felt. 
    Matte keeps Coltivare on the cutting edge of computer vision technology. If you are interested in learning more about computer vision algorithms Matte recommends that you start by reading this classic <a href = "Convolution_nets.pdf" target = "_blank">research paper</a>. </p>
